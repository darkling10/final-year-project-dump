"MIT_physics_rel","DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICSDEPARTMENT OF PHYSICSThe Department of Physics oers undergraduate  graduate and postgraduate training  with a wide range of options forspecialization.The emphasis of both the undergraduate curriculum and thegraduate program is on understanding the fundamental principlesthat appear to govern the behavior of the physical world  includingspace and time and matter and energy in all its forms  from thesubatomic to the cosmological and from the elementary to thecomplex.The Department of Physics strives to be at the forefront of manyareas where new physics can be found. Consequently  thedepartment works on problems where extreme conditions may revealnew behavior: from clusters of galaxies or the entire universe toelementary particles or the strings that may be the substructure ofthese particles; from collisions of nuclei at relativistic velocities thatmake droplets of matter hotter than anything since the Big Bangto laser-cooled atoms so cold that their wave functions overlap resulting in a macroscopic collective state  the Bose-Einsteincondensate; and from individual atoms to unusual materials  such ashigh-temperature superconductors and those that are important inbiology. Pushing the limits provides the opportunity to observe newgeneral principles and test theories of the structure and behavior ofmatter and energy.Undergraduate StudyBachelor of Science in Physics (Course 8)An undergraduate degree in physics provides an excellent basisnot only for graduate study in physics and related elds  but alsofor professional work in such elds as astrophysics  biophysics engineering and applied physics  geophysics  management law  or medicine. The undergraduate curriculum oers studentsthe opportunity to acquire a deep conceptual understanding offundamental physics. The core departmental requirements beginthis process. The student then chooses one of two options tocomplete the degree: the focused option (http://catalog.mit.edu/degree-charts/physics-course-8/#focusedoptiontext) is designed forstudents who plan to pursue physics as a career  and is an excellentchoice for students who want to experience as deep an engagementas possible with physics; the flexible option (http://catalog.mit.edu/degree-charts/physics-course-8/#flexibleoptiontext) also providesa very strong physics framework  and gives students who may wantto pursue additional academic interests the flexibility to do so.Both programs prepare students very well for graduate studies inphysics  as well as for a variety of academic or research-relatedcareers. Either option provides a considerable amount of time forexploration through electives. Students proceed at the pace anddegree of specialization best suited to their individual capacities.Both options lead to the same degree: the Bachelor of Science inPhysics.Physics: Focused OptionThis option—which includes three terms of quantum mechanics  36units of laboratory experience  and a thesis—is ideal preparation fora career in physics.In the second year  students take:8.03 Physics III 128.033 Relativity 128.04 Quantum Physics I 128.044 Statistical Physics I 128.223 Classical Mechanics II 6Important skills for experimentation in physics may be acquiredby starting an Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program(UROP) (http://catalog.mit.edu/mit/undergraduate-education/academic-research-options/undergraduate-research-opportunities-program) project.In the third year  students normally take laboratory subjects:8.13& 8.14Experimental Physics Iand Experimental Physics II368.05& 8.06Quantum Physics IIand Quantum Physics III24Students should also begin to take the restricted elective subjects one in mathematics and at least two in physics. The mathematicssubjects 18.04 Complex Variables with Applications  18.075Methods for Scientists and Engineers  and 18.06 Linear Algebra areparticularly popular with physics majors. Topical elective subjectsin astrophysics  biological physics  condensed matter  plasma  andnuclear and particle physics allow students to gain an appreciationof the forefronts of modern physics. Students intending to go on tograduate school in physics are encouraged to take the theoreticalphysics sequence:8.07 Electromagnetism II 128.08 Statistical Physics II 128.09 Classical Mechanics III 12An important component of this option is the thesis  which is aphysics research project carried out under the guidance of a facultymember. Many thesis projects grow naturally out of UROP projects.Students should have some idea of a thesis topic by the middleof the junior year. A thesis proposal must be submitted beforeregistering for thesis units and no later than Add Date of the fall termof the senior year.Department of Physics   |   3DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICSA relatively large amount of elective time usually becomes availableduring the fourth year and can be used either to deepen one'sbackground in physics or to explore other disciplines.Physics: Flexible OptionThis option is designed for students who wish to develop a strongbackground in the fundamentals of physics and then build onthis foundation as they prepare for career paths that may or maynot involve a graduate degree in physics. Many students nd anunderstanding of the basic concepts of physics and an appreciationof the physicist's approach to problem solving an excellentpreparation for the growing spectrum of nontraditional  technology-related career opportunities  as well as for careers in business  law medicine  or engineering. Additionally  the flexible option makesit more possible for students with diverse intellectual interests topursue a second major in another department.The option begins with the core subjects:8.01 Physics I 128.02 Physics II 128.03 Physics III 128.04 Quantum Physics I 128.044 Statistical Physics I 128.21 Physics of Energy 12or 8.223 Classical Mechanics IIStudents round out their foundation material with either anadditional quantum mechanics subject (8.05 Quantum PhysicsII) or a subject in relativity (8.20 Introduction to Special Relativityor 8.033 Relativity). There is an experimental requirement of 8.13Experimental Physics I or  with the approval of the department  alaboratory subject of similar intensity in another department  anexperimental research project or senior thesis  or an experimentallyoriented summer externship. An exploration requirement consistsof one elective subject in physics. Students can satisfy thedepartmental portion of the Communication Requirement by takingtwo of the following subjects:8.06 Quantum Physics III 128.13 Experimental Physics I 188.14 Experimental Physics II 188.225[J] Einstein  Oppenheimer  Feynman:Physics in the 20th Century128.226 Forty-three Orders of Magnitude 128.287[J] Observational Techniques of OpticalAstronomy15The department and the Subcommittee on the CommunicationRequirement may accept substitution of one of the department's tworequired CI-M subjects with a CI-M subject in another department if itforms a natural part of the student's physics program.Students following this option must also complete a focusrequirement—three subjects forming one intellectually coherent unitin some area (not necessarily physics)  subject to the approval of thedepartment and separate from those used by the student to satisfythe HASS requirement. Areas of focus chosen by students haveincluded astronomy  biology  computational physics  theoreticalphysics  nanotechnology  history of science  science and technologypolicy  philosophy  and science teaching. Some students maychoose to satisfy their experimental and exploration requirements inthe same area as their focus; others may opt for greater breadth bychoosing other elds to fulll these requirements.Although students may choose this option at any time in theirundergraduate career  many decide on the flexible major during theirsophomore year in order to have enough time to cra a program thatbest suits their individual needs. Specic subject choices for theexperimental and focus requirements require the written approval ofthe Flexible Program coordinator  Dr. Sean P. Robinson.Minor in PhysicsThe Minor in Physics provides a solid foundation for the pursuit ofa broad range of professional activities in science and engineering.The requirements for a Minor in Physics are as follows: 18.03 Dierential Equations 1 12Select ve Course 8 subjects beyond the GeneralInstitute Requirements57-60Total Units 69-721 18.032 Dierential Equations is also acceptable.Students should submit a completed Minor Application Form toPhysics Academic Programs  Room 4-315. The Physics Department'sminor coordinator is Catherine Modica. See UndergraduateEducation for more information on minor programs (http://catalog.mit.edu/mit/undergraduate-education/academic-programs/minors).Minor in AstronomyThe Minor in Astronomy (http://catalog.mit.edu/interdisciplinary/undergraduate-programs/minors/astronomy)  oered jointly withthe Department of Earth  Atmospheric  and Planetary Sciences covers the observational and theoretical foundations of astronomy.For a description of the minor  see Interdisciplinary Programs.InquiriesAdditional information concerning degree programs and researchactivities may be obtained by contacting the department oce(physics-undergrad@mit.edu)  Room 4-315  617-253-4841.4   |   Department of PhysicsDEPARTMENT OF PHYSICSGraduate StudyThe Physics Department oers programs leading to the degrees ofMaster of Science in Physics and Doctor of Philosophy.Admission Requirements for Graduate StudyStudents intending to pursue graduate work in physics should haveas a background the equivalent of the requirements for the Bachelorof Science in Physics from MIT. However  students may make upsome deciencies over the course of their graduate work.Master of Science in PhysicsThe normal degree program in the department leads to a PhDin Physics. Admission to a master's degree program in Physicsis available only in special cases (e.g.  US military ocers). Therequirements for the Master of Science in Physics are the sameas the General Degree Requirements (http://catalog.mit.edu/mit/graduate-education/general-degree-requirements) listed underGraduate Education. A master's thesis must represent a piece ofindependent research work in any of the elds described below and must be carried out under the supervision of a departmentfaculty member. No xed time is set for the completion of a master'sprogram; two years of work is a rough guideline. There is nolanguage requirement for this degree.Doctor of PhilosophyCandidates for the Doctor of Philosophy or Doctor of Science areexpected to enroll in those basic graduate subjects that preparethem for the general examination  which must be passed nolater than in the seventh term aer initial enrollment. Studentsare required to take two subjects in the candidate's doctoralresearch area (specialty requirement) and two subjects outsidethe candidate's eld of specialization (breadth requirement). Inaddition  all students in the rst year of the PhD program mustenroll in two semesters of 8.398  a seminar specically for rst-yearstudents. Half of the breadth requirement may be satised througha departmentally approved industrial internship. The doctoral thesismust represent a substantial piece of original research  carried outunder the supervision of a department faculty member.The Physics Department faculty members oer subjects ofinstruction and are engaged in research in a variety of elds inexperimental and theoretical physics. This broad spectrum ofactivities is organized in the divisional structure of the department presented below. Graduate students are encouraged to contactfaculty members in the division of their choice to inquire aboutopportunities for research  and to pass through an apprenticeship(by signing up for Pre-Thesis Research) as a rst step toward anengagement in independent research for a doctoral thesis.Research DivisionsFaculty and students in the Department of Physics are generallyaliated with one of several research divisions:• Astrophysics• Experimental Nuclear and Particle Physics• Atomic Physics  Biophysics  Condensed Matter Physics  andPlasma Physics• Theoretical Nuclear and Particle PhysicsMuch of the research in the department is carried out as part ofthe work of various interdisciplinary laboratories and centers including the Center for Materials Science and Engineering  FrancisBitter Magnet Laboratory  Haystack Observatory  Laboratory forNuclear Science  Microsystems Technology Laboratories  MITKavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research  PlasmaScience and Fusion Center  Research Laboratory of Electronics and Spectroscopy Laboratory. Additional information aboutinterdisciplinary laboratories and centers can be found underResearch and Study (http://catalog.mit.edu/mit/research). Thesefacilities provide close relationships among the research activitiesof a number of MIT departments and give students opportunities forcontact with research carried out in disciplines other than physics.InquiriesAdditional information on degree programs  research activities admissions  nancial aid  teaching and research assistantshipsmay be obtained by contacting the department oce (physics-grad@mit.edu)  Room 4-315  617-253-4851.Faculty and Teaching StaDeepto Chakrabarty  PhDProfessor of PhysicsHead  Department of PhysicsProfessorsRaymond Ashoori  PhDProfessor of PhysicsEdmund Bertschinger  PhDProfessor of PhysicsClaude R.
