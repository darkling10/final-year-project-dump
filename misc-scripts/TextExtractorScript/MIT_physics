DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICS

DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICS

The Department of Physics oers undergraduate, graduate,
and postgraduate training, with a wide range of options for
specialization.

The emphasis of both the undergraduate curriculum and the
graduate program is on understanding the fundamental principles
that appear to govern the behavior of the physical world, including
space and time and matter and energy in all its forms, from the
subatomic to the cosmological and from the elementary to the
complex.

The Department of Physics strives to be at the forefront of many
areas where new physics can be found. Consequently, the
department works on problems where extreme conditions may reveal
new behavior: from clusters of galaxies or the entire universe to
elementary particles or the strings that may be the substructure of
these particles; from collisions of nuclei at relativistic velocities that
make droplets of matter hotter than anything since the Big Bang
to laser-cooled atoms so cold that their wave functions overlap,
resulting in a macroscopic collective state, the Bose-Einstein
condensate; and from individual atoms to unusual materials, such as
high-temperature superconductors and those that are important in
biology. Pushing the limits provides the opportunity to observe new
general principles and test theories of the structure and behavior of
matter and energy.

Undergraduate Study

Bachelor of Science in Physics (Course 8)
An undergraduate degree in physics provides an excellent basis
not only for graduate study in physics and related elds, but also
for professional work in such elds as astrophysics, biophysics,
engineering and applied physics, geophysics, management,
law, or medicine. The undergraduate curriculum oers students
the opportunity to acquire a deep conceptual understanding of
fundamental physics. The core departmental requirements begin
this process. The student then chooses one of two options to
complete the degree: the focused option (http://catalog.mit.edu/
degree-charts/physics-course-8/#focusedoptiontext) is designed for
students who plan to pursue physics as a career, and is an excellent
choice for students who want to experience as deep an engagement
as possible with physics; the flexible option (http://catalog.mit.edu/
degree-charts/physics-course-8/#flexibleoptiontext) also provides
a very strong physics framework, and gives students who may want
to pursue additional academic interests the flexibility to do so.
Both programs prepare students very well for graduate studies in
physics, as well as for a variety of academic or research-related
careers. Either option provides a considerable amount of time for
exploration through electives. Students proceed at the pace and
degree of specialization best suited to their individual capacities.

Both options lead to the same degree: the Bachelor of Science in
Physics.

Physics: Focused Option
This option—which includes three terms of quantum mechanics, 36
units of laboratory experience, and a thesis—is ideal preparation for
a career in physics.

In the second year, students take:

8.03 Physics III 12
8.033 Relativity 12
8.04 Quantum Physics I 12
8.044 Statistical Physics I 12
8.223 Classical Mechanics II 6

Important skills for experimentation in physics may be acquired
by starting an Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program
(UROP) (http://catalog.mit.edu/mit/undergraduate-education/
academic-research-options/undergraduate-research-opportunities-
program) project.

In the third year, students normally take laboratory subjects:

8.13
& 8.14

Experimental Physics I
and Experimental Physics II

36

8.05
& 8.06

Quantum Physics II
and Quantum Physics III

24

Students should also begin to take the restricted elective subjects,
one in mathematics and at least two in physics. The mathematics
subjects 18.04 Complex Variables with Applications, 18.075
Methods for Scientists and Engineers, and 18.06 Linear Algebra are
particularly popular with physics majors. Topical elective subjects
in astrophysics, biological physics, condensed matter, plasma, and
nuclear and particle physics allow students to gain an appreciation
of the forefronts of modern physics. Students intending to go on to
graduate school in physics are encouraged to take the theoretical
physics sequence:

8.07 Electromagnetism II 12
8.08 Statistical Physics II 12
8.09 Classical Mechanics III 12

An important component of this option is the thesis, which is a
physics research project carried out under the guidance of a faculty
member. Many thesis projects grow naturally out of UROP projects.
Students should have some idea of a thesis topic by the middle
of the junior year. A thesis proposal must be submitted before
registering for thesis units and no later than Add Date of the fall term
of the senior year.

DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICS

A relatively large amount of elective time usually becomes available
during the fourth year and can be used either to deepen one's
background in physics or to explore other disciplines.

Physics: Flexible Option
This option is designed for students who wish to develop a strong
background in the fundamentals of physics and then build on
this foundation as they prepare for career paths that may or may
not involve a graduate degree in physics. Many students nd an
understanding of the basic concepts of physics and an appreciation
of the physicist's approach to problem solving an excellent
preparation for the growing spectrum of nontraditional, technology-
related career opportunities, as well as for careers in business, law,
medicine, or engineering. Additionally, the flexible option makes
it more possible for students with diverse intellectual interests to
pursue a second major in another department.

The option begins with the core subjects:

8.01 Physics I 12
8.02 Physics II 12
8.03 Physics III 12
8.04 Quantum Physics I 12
8.044 Statistical Physics I 12
8.21 Physics of Energy 12

or 8.223 Classical Mechanics II

Students round out their foundation material with either an
additional quantum mechanics subject (8.05 Quantum Physics
II) or a subject in relativity (8.20 Introduction to Special Relativity
or 8.033 Relativity). There is an experimental requirement of 8.13
Experimental Physics I or, with the approval of the department, a
laboratory subject of similar intensity in another department, an
experimental research project or senior thesis, or an experimentally
oriented summer externship. An exploration requirement consists
of one elective subject in physics. Students can satisfy the
departmental portion of the Communication Requirement by taking
two of the following subjects:

8.06 Quantum Physics III 12
8.13 Experimental Physics I 18
8.14 Experimental Physics II 18
8.225[J] Einstein, Oppenheimer, Feynman:

Physics in the 20th Century
12

8.226 Forty-three Orders of Magnitude 12
8.287[J] Observational Techniques of Optical

Astronomy
15

The department and the Subcommittee on the Communication
Requirement may accept substitution of one of the department's two
required CI-M subjects with a CI-M subject in another department if it
forms a natural part of the student's physics program.

Students following this option must also complete a focus
requirement—three subjects forming one intellectually coherent unit
in some area (not necessarily physics), subject to the approval of the
department and separate from those used by the student to satisfy
the HASS requirement. Areas of focus chosen by students have
included astronomy, biology, computational physics, theoretical
physics, nanotechnology, history of science, science and technology
policy, philosophy, and science teaching. Some students may
choose to satisfy their experimental and exploration requirements in
the same area as their focus; others may opt for greater breadth by
choosing other elds to fulll these requirements.

Although students may choose this option at any time in their
undergraduate career, many decide on the flexible major during their
sophomore year in order to have enough time to cra a program that
best suits their individual needs. Specic subject choices for the
experimental and focus requirements require the written approval of
the Flexible Program coordinator, Dr. Sean P. Robinson.

Minor in Physics
The Minor in Physics provides a solid foundation for the pursuit of
a broad range of professional activities in science and engineering.
The requirements for a Minor in Physics are as follows: 

18.03 Dierential Equations 1 12
Select ve Course 8 subjects beyond the General
Institute Requirements

57-60

Total Units 69-72

1 18.032 Dierential Equations is also acceptable.

Students should submit a completed Minor Application Form to
Physics Academic Programs, Room 4-315. The Physics Department's
minor coordinator is Catherine Modica. See Undergraduate
Education for more information on minor programs (http://
catalog.mit.edu/mit/undergraduate-education/academic-programs/
minors).

Minor in Astronomy
The Minor in Astronomy (http://catalog.mit.edu/interdisciplinary/
undergraduate-programs/minors/astronomy), oered jointly with
the Department of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences,
covers the observational and theoretical foundations of astronomy.
For a description of the minor, see Interdisciplinary Programs.

DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICS

Graduate Study

The Physics Department oers programs leading to the degrees of
Master of Science in Physics and Doctor of Philosophy.

Admission Requirements for Graduate Study
Students intending to pursue graduate work in physics should have
as a background the equivalent of the requirements for the Bachelor
of Science in Physics from MIT. However, students may make up
some deciencies over the course of their graduate work.

Master of Science in Physics
The normal degree program in the department leads to a PhD
in Physics. Admission to a master's degree program in Physics
is available only in special cases (e.g., US military ocers). The
requirements for the Master of Science in Physics are the same
as the General Degree Requirements (http://catalog.mit.edu/mit/
graduate-education/general-degree-requirements) listed under
Graduate Education. A master's thesis must represent a piece of
independent research work in any of the elds described below,
and must be carried out under the supervision of a department
faculty member. No xed time is set for the completion of a master's
program; two years of work is a rough guideline. There is no
language requirement for this degree.

Doctor of Philosophy
Candidates for the Doctor of Philosophy or Doctor of Science are
expected to enroll in those basic graduate subjects that prepare
them for the general examination, which must be passed no
later than in the seventh term aer initial enrollment. Students
are required to take two subjects in the candidate's doctoral
research area (specialty requirement) and two subjects outside
the candidate's eld of specialization (breadth requirement). In
addition, all students in the rst year of the PhD program must
enroll in two semesters of 8.398, a seminar specically for rst-year
students. Half of the breadth requirement may be satised through
a departmentally approved industrial internship. The doctoral thesis
must represent a substantial piece of original research, carried out
under the supervision of a department faculty member.

The Physics Department faculty members oer subjects of
instruction and are engaged in research in a variety of elds in
experimental and theoretical physics. This broad spectrum of
activities is organized in the divisional structure of the department,
presented below. Graduate students are encouraged to contact
faculty members in the division of their choice to inquire about
opportunities for research, and to pass through an apprenticeship
(by signing up for Pre-Thesis Research) as a rst step toward an
engagement in independent research for a doctoral thesis.

Research Divisions
Faculty and students in the Department of Physics are generally
aliated with one of several research divisions:

• Astrophysics
• Experimental Nuclear and Particle Physics
• Atomic Physics, Biophysics, Condensed Matter Physics, and

Plasma Physics
• Theoretical Nuclear and Particle Physics

Much of the research in the department is carried out as part of
the work of various interdisciplinary laboratories and centers,
including the Center for Materials Science and Engineering, Francis
Bitter Magnet Laboratory, Haystack Observatory, Laboratory for
Nuclear Science, Microsystems Technology Laboratories, MIT
Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research, Plasma
Science and Fusion Center, Research Laboratory of Electronics,
and Spectroscopy Laboratory. Additional information about
interdisciplinary laboratories and centers can be found under
Research and Study (http://catalog.mit.edu/mit/research). These
facilities provide close relationships among the research activities
of a number of MIT departments and give students opportunities for
contact with research carried out in disciplines other than physics.

Inquiries
Additional information on degree programs, research activities,
admissions, nancial aid, teaching and research assistantships
may be obtained by contacting the department oce (physics-
grad@mit.edu), Room 4-315, 617-253-4851.
